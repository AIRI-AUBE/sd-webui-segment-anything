      description: I can do very little help to people who are unable to install GroundingDINO. However, you may choose to use the local GroundingDINO. Otherwise, you should submit an issue in GroundingDINO or Grounded-SAM repository.

      description: Some extensions prevent me to reorder extension list inside the backend of WebUI. Following the step above can achieve the same effect as reordering extension list.
      options:
